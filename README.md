# Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent claims are those that involve conspiring to make false or exaggerated claims involving property damage or personal injuries following an accident. Detecting such claims is crucial for insurance companies to prevent losses.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a model that can detect fraudulent insurance claims. The model uses machine learning algorithms to learn from historical fraud patterns and recognize them in future transactions. The model is trained on a dataset of insurance claims and their corresponding labels (fraudulent or non-fraudulent). The model is then tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/buntyshah/insurance-fraud-claims-detection). It contains information about auto insurance claims, including the policy holder's demographic information, vehicle information, and claim details.

## Methodology

The methodology used in this project involves the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values, handle categorical variables, and normalize the data.

2. Feature engineering: New features are created from the existing features to improve the model's performance.

3. Model selection: Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated, and the best-performing algorithm is selected.

4. Model training: The selected algorithm is trained on the preprocessed dataset.

5. Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its performance.

## Results

The results of this project show that the selected machine learning algorithm can accurately detect fraudulent insurance claims. The model achieves an accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.85 on the test dataset.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent vehicle insurance claims. The model developed in this project can be used by insurance companies to prevent losses due to fraudulent claims.
